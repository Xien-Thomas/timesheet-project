# ​Project background and description​
AOI’s contractors do not have access to AOI internal time sheet system. Currently, AOI sends an approval email to a vendor without a record of the contractor’s time sheet. The time sheet entries can consist of hours worked, PTO, vacation, and sick days that can be useful information for AOI time sheet team. 
 
The system that we propose will record the contractor's time sheet entries and create an automated message for AOI to send to a vendor. The system is a proof of concept, and our goal is to introduce this system and plans to improve the system.
